## Biography
I am **Yuze Sui**, a 4th-year Ph.D. Candidate in Sociology with a Ph.D. Minor in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University. My research focuses on **careers**, **bureaucracy**, **computational social science**, and their intersections. I investigate the emergence and diffusion of social structures, policies, and scientific ideas using advanced computational techniques. My work has been published on prestigious peer-review outlets, including PNAS Nexus, Management and Organizational Review, the Harvard Business Review. I have presented at premier conferences across both traditional and computational social science communities, including the Academy of Management Annual Meeting (2025), the American Sociological Association Annual Meeting (2023â€“2025), the American Political Science Association Annual Meeting (2021), the International Conference on Computational Social Science (2024), and the ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (2025).
